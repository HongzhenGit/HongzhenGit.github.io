      Extension of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy: A micron-level thickness gauging technology</a> <br> with SHI Lili and HE Mingxia <br>

      <p> There is a minimum measurable thickness when gauging micron-level coating films with time-of-flight based terahertz thickness measurement technologies. To improve this minimum measurable limit, 
        a time-domain model of terahertz signals is derived by considering multiple reflected pulses, using the Differential Evolution algorithm to calibrate parameters automatically. 
        Empirical Mode Decomposition is applied to remove noises and non-flat baselines introduced by water vapor and other structure-borne noise resources. Combining methods mentioned above, 
        thicknesses of micron-level coating layers could be measured even if the Signal to Noise Ratio is not large enough, and the minimum measurable limit is also improved to about 40μm. 
        Experiments also demonstrate that, during drying processes, the time gaps between pulses reflected from different interfaces shrink and the thicknesses change in an exponential trend, 
        which reveals the potential of terahertz technologies in terms of monitoring coating processes </p></div>

      Terahertz thickness measurement based on stochastic optimization algorithm</a> <br> with HE Mingxia, SHI Lili and WANG Pengfei <br>

    Abstract

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">
      <p>Coating is an indispensable process in automobile, marine, aerospace manufacturing and other industries. Reasonable film thickness is not only conducive to the stability of painting quality, but also conducive to saving paint and reducing painting cost. 
        With the advent of industrial 4.0 era, it is an inevitable trend to realize online, non-contact, non-destructive and high-precision detection. Compared with traditional measurement methods, THz thickness measurement method could perform non-contact online measurement. 
        However, when the optical thickness of the sample is small, terahertz reflection pulses will overlap in the time domain, and it is impossible to obtain the exact flight time directly from the peak position of the pulses. In order to solve this problem, 
        a thickness measurement method based on reflective terahertz time domain spectroscopy system and stochastic optimization algorithm is proposed. A multivariate regression model of terahertz reflection pulses is established. With the application of Differential Evolution algorithm, 
        the thickness of the sample is calculated automatically. The convergence of the differential evolution algorithm was verified by calculating the results from the same time-domain signal several times. 
        The measurement error introduced by the angle error between the normal direction of the substrate and the direction of terahertz probe is also evaluated. In addition, the feasibility of time-of-flight (TOF) method for measuring the thickness of each layer in multi-layer structure samples is studied. 
        The measurement results show that the calculated results of Differential Evolution algorithm are stable. The uncertainty of thicknesses of zinc dipping paint, black paint and base paint are 0.22μm(223.87μm), 0.05μm(54.18μm) and 0.08μm(284.95μm), respectively. 
        The uncertainty of refractive indexes is 0.004(3.967), 002(2.091) and 0.001(1.769), respectively. For zinc dipping paint, angle error of   leads to a measurement error of 0.073. Due to the existence of multiple reflection effects, 
        although the method can find the flight time of each reflection pulse in the terahertz measurement signal of many layers of samples, it is impossible to distinguish which reflection interface the reflection pulse comes from, so that the thickness of each layer coating cannot be solved. 
        The analysis shows that the thickness measurement method based on the time-of-flight principle is simple and easy, and the thickness of the single-layer sample can be measured more accurately, which is not sensitive to the angle error. When expanding to the measurement of multi-layer samples, 
        the method has greater limitations. It is impossible to distinguish multiple reflection pulses in the time domain, and is not feasible to calculate the thickness of each layer. </p></div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </p></div><br>

      Abstract

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This paper examines location as an outcome of college major choice. We document substantial differences in the spatial availability of college majors. These differences explain much of the cross-major variation in unemployment and migration, but not earnings. Using a natural experiment, we show that migration differences across majors appear to be driven by labor demand and not labor supply.</p></div><br>
